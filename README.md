# Hotend_Flowrate_Chart
 
This project is indended as a way to sort of crowdsource hotend flowrate data. Of course everyones setup is different, and may not achieve exactly the same flowrates. Along with that, the testing method is somewhat subjective, but I think we could get a decent idea of flowrates with enough data.

I use LibreOffice Calc, so the file is saved in it's native .ods format. I think you should be able to import this into Excel or Sheets, but LibreOffice is free and open source, so.

The "Useful max flowrate" seaction is where we will run into the issue of subjectivity. Personally, I like to keep my max flowrate somewhere around just before the test print starts turning from shiny to matte, as in my experience this tends to help aid layer adhesion slightly. So that's how I will judge what value to put here.

The "Flow at first skip" section is pretty self explanitory I think. This is the flowrate where you get the first extruder skip on the test print.

This project is in it's very early stages and I realize that it is very unpolished. I hope to improve it over time. If anyone has ideas on how to improve it you are more than welcome to submit a Pull Request. I hope this can turn into a useful tool in our toolboxes.
